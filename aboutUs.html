      <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
      <h6>
        The Directorate of Open and Distance Learning(DODL), Dibrugarh
        University was established in 2001 with a vision to reach the unreached.
        During the last three decades, it was observed that most of the
        Department and the Centres of studies of the University received a large
        number of applications for admission into different programmes offered.
        Due to limited number of seats in post-graduate and under-graduate
        classes, a large number of students fail to enroll themselves as
        students of the University. Considering the necessity of enabling the
        youths who are either employed or self-employed and who are unable to
        prosecute higher education due to economic or other reasons, the
        University has set the vision of taking Higher Education to the
        doorsteps of the learners.
